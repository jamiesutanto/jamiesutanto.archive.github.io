<p>Being hacked BEFORE your site is made public has been the best tutorial for the internet!</p>
<h1 id="the-journey">The Journey<a href="#the-journey" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s 6 AM in the morning, you wake up and appreciate the joy of a tutorial to introduce you to the internet.  This is my inspiration for my blog post today, much different then my much more panicky self yesterday!</p>
<h2 id="the-night-before">The Night Before<a href="#the-night-before" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s 10 PM and after mulling ideas for your first post, you build up the willpower to actually start writing.  You log-in and are introduced to a spam site&hellip;  Welcome to the internet&hellip;.</p>
<p>Your first thought is panic!  How could this be with such a fresh domain name that hasn&rsquo;t even been made public.  Post-Reflection &hellip;<em>And then you realise that everything on the internet is public from the day it&rsquo;s published!</em></p>
<h2 id="the-search">The Search<a href="#the-search" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>As with all problems, first stop search for an answer!</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Website replaced with spam site&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Website points to site I didn&rsquo;t make&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Porkbun site suddenly changed&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;URL points to spam site&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Website hacked&rdquo;
Then you realise there are A LOT of different ways all of the above could mean, but after much reading you learn the terms DNS Poisoning, URL Hijacking and URL Re-direction and so many other terms that you realise you may be out of your depth!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="porkbun-adventures">Porkbun Adventures<a href="#porkbun-adventures" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Good news, you have Support, so a message to Porkbun and you realise you likely won&rsquo;t get a reply for 24 hours&hellip;..</p>
<p>So time to just experiment!  And see what actually causes the site to resolve incorrectly.  So delete all settings you aren&rsquo;t aware of.</p>
<ul>
<li>URL Forwarding&hellip;.. Still there.</li>
<li>DNS A Record&hellip;. Still there.</li>
<li>DNS AAAA records&hellip;. Still there.</li>
<li>DNS MX records&hellip;.. Still there.</li>
<li>DNS TXT records&hellip;.. Still there.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>So sounds like it&rsquo;s time to go more nuclear, where you find the Porkbun Park command!  Reset to Factory Defaults exactly what I was looking for!  And&hellip;. still there.</p>
<p>Few more searches, and all these changes do take a while to apply&hellip; For me about 30 minutes, and finally arrived at a wonderful Parked page!  Time for some tea, and back to square one!</p>
<p>Reconnect Github Pages on Porkbun&hellip;. and it came back!  Looks like it&rsquo;s actually a Github Pages issue, so onto the next rabbit hole.</p>
<h2 id="github-pages-adventure">Github Pages Adventure<a href="#github-pages-adventure" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Back to Github Pages, apply your custom domain and greeted with the message of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The custom domain thesinglerun.com is already taken.  If you are the owner of this domain &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Follow the link, and didn&rsquo;t actually understand how to re-claim it (it was late!), so first stop Github Support!  Where the first thing you realise is that Free users can&rsquo;t actually create support&hellip;.</p>
<p>So instead a Virtual Assistant happily offers to check your domain name, and reports all is well!</p>
<p>Great!  Go back, and try to add the custom domain and still taken.</p>
<p>So, back to the support board with the many options to try and create a post!  Create Ticket was in the less obvious top right corner (away from the big squares) and once there punched in my description.</p>
<p>Github has a handy Co-Pilot check and try to address your problem BEFORE your ticket gets submitted, and strangely reading the exact same docs as the previous link in chat form made sense!</p>
<p>With these new instructions setup my DNS TXT file, added my custom domain, and boom my site is back!</p>
<h2 id="post-the-actual-fix">Post the Actual Fix!<a href="#post-the-actual-fix" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Strangely after realising the root cause I wanted to know how widespread this was!  (It&rsquo;s strange how the human brain works).</p>
<p>And I found the exact same issue documented here!
<a href="https://medium.com/@jehy/hijacking-domain-using-github-pages-41c80ac57523">https://medium.com/@jehy/hijacking-domain-using-github-pages-41c80ac57523</a></p>
<p>And like <em>jehy</em> I also wanted to report the issue, but realised it was on a Private Repo.  So being a good citizen:</p>
<ol>
<li>I let Porkbun Support know all is well and that it was a Github Pages issue!</li>
<li>I logged a Feature Request to Github to see if they could make Verifying Custom Domains mandatory (and if they could blacklist the hackers as well!)</li>
</ol>
<p>With that all logged, I filled in my journal and surprisingly wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got hacked!  Learnt Heaps&rdquo;</p>
<p>40 minutes past midnight!  Time to sleep!</p>
<h2 id="reflections">Reflections!<a href="#reflections" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Back to the present, I&rsquo;m really am seeing the joy of being hacked!  (especially with timing!) so thanks for the tutorial!</p>
