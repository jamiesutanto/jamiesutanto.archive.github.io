<p>Still too perfectionist to not just <strong>do</strong>, but <strong>research first</strong>!</p>
<p>The newsletters / blogs I consume are quite diverse!  I want to lean into posts that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Succinct</li>
<li>Include things I&rsquo;m enjoying (as a callout)</li>
<li>Possibly Handwritten (maybe post-its)</li>
<li>A Question</li>
</ul>
<p>Rogue-like Deckbuilders are fun!  So researching them themselves leads to lots of gaming!  Keen to:</p>

<li>Use the path as a map.  With choices both taken and untaken.</li>

<h3 id="intro">Intro<a href="#intro" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>After passing the Being Hacked tutorial, I felt ready to tackle the world of my first <strong>real</strong> blog post!  The challenge being, I don&rsquo;t yet have a voice&hellip;.</p>
<p>The best approach would be to not worry too much about it and just start writing!  BUT my <em>perfectionist mind</em> thought it&rsquo;d be much better to spend time researching&hellip;..  So today&rsquo;s story is about that journey.</p>
<h3 id="newsletters-i-read">Newsletters I Read<a href="#newsletters-i-read" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>The obvious place to start, is what I actually read and enjoy myself!  Then to think about what I enjoy about each.</p>
<p>Seth&rsquo;s Blog - The succint-ness of Seth&rsquo;s Blog is so powerful (even though it seems really hard to do!)  But the ability to distill knowledge into a concise point is worth aspiring to.
Ness Labs - AI Image &gt; What&rsquo;s going on Now &gt; A Concept with Imagery &gt; Post Script (things I&rsquo;m Enjoying).  I always find these newletters insightful, part structure, with the images in particular being a stand-out to make the concept real!
The Imperfectionist - You have to accept that your life is finite!  A title &gt; a concept &gt; bold to emphasise one point &gt; end with a quote / analogy / reference.  This newsletter just speaks to me, which whilst no magic formula can teach me about how to do things.
Zen Habits - Title &gt; Down Arrow &gt; Text.  One bold only!  Start with questions you ask yourself then extrapolate!
The Minimalists - In poetry form.  Short incomplete sentences to represent a whole.
Eric Barker - Very how to.  Picture &gt; Intro &gt; Details &gt; Summary
Shane Parrish - Tiny Thoughts (One liners / three of them seperated by * / ** / *** ) - Insights (Single paragraphs with a lesson) - Repository (link to someone else) - PS (life links / interesting things)
Mathias Jakobsen - The idea of physical pages as newsletters is such a cool one! Challenge being on how to be clear and succinct!  Digital could help!  Ask a question at the end

<h3 id="what-ill-do-with-it">What I&rsquo;ll do with it<a href="#what-ill-do-with-it" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>With that done &hellip; here&rsquo;s some ideas I like!</p>
<ul>
<li>Succinct</li>
<li>Things I&rsquo;m Enjoying (as a callout)</li>
<li>Possibly Handwritten Page (maybe post-its)</li>
<li>A Question</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="games">Games<a href="#games" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>The Blog is based on the idea of a <strong>rogue-like</strong> so I booted up Slay The Spire and One Step From Eden to see how they record their journey!</p>
<h3 id="slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire<a href="#slay-the-spire" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>This actually doesn&rsquo;t show where you are on a Stage, it&rsquo;s just the Path &gt; The Event</p>
<h3 id="one-step-from-eden">One Step From Eden<a href="#one-step-from-eden" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>This displays your progress on the bottom right corner:
1-1 (first choice) 1-2 (second choice) etc until you complete the level.  Then you move on.</p>
<h3 id="ideas">Ideas<a href="#ideas" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>The structure of having some <a href="https://aaron.com/2013/08/13/the-best-goal-achievement-strategy/">MTO Goal</a> may be a good way to define these <em>Levels</em> BUT what if we change the goal posts or never get there entirely?  How does that work in the system?  Or is it just time itself - A year or some meaningful juncture between Annual Reports?</p>
<p>If we could have an image of the path (and the one not taken that would be quite cool too!)  It shows intentionality on where you are going!</p>
<p>This can be a site-map as well let&rsquo;s see!</p>
