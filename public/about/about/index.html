We all have our own unique start point based on our life experience. We have choices that we make each and every day. There are no take backs and time always move forwards.

<p>Hi! My name is Jamie Sutanto and you&rsquo;ve stumbled across my site The Single Run.  Thanks for being here!</p>
<p>This site is my personal site where I treat my life with the mindset of a <em>Single Run</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>We all have our own <strong>unique start point</strong> based on our life experience.</li>
<li>We have <strong>choices</strong> that we make each and every day.</li>
<li>There are <strong>no take backs</strong> and <strong>time always move forwards</strong>.</li>
<li>And with those in mind, we can now <strong>decide</strong> how we choose to live our lives.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoy your time here, exploring the random events of my life!</p>
<h2 id="whats-on-the-site">What&rsquo;s on the Site?<a href="#whats-on-the-site" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>This site will talk about:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Single Run Mindset and philosophy surrounding life from this viewpoint.</li>
<li>Experiments that I&rsquo;m currently undertaking (based on Tiny Experiments).</li>
<li>A Journal of my Daily Life.</li>
<li>Lessons Learnt from Life Experiences.</li>
<li>Reviews on things I consume in my life mostly books, games and restaurants.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="whats-behind-the-single-run">What&rsquo;s Behind the Single Run?<a href="#whats-behind-the-single-run" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Life in a rogue-like.</em>
<em>Each day a new hand is dealt.</em>
<em>Let&rsquo;s now play it out!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The Single Run is inspired by the genre of video games called <em>Rogue-like Deckbuilders</em>, this is the genre I play and hope to create one day!</p>
<p><em>Roguelike Deckbuilders</em> are made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run</strong> - A complete game from start to finish, where you win or die trying.</li>
<li><strong>Permadeath</strong> - When you die, you need to restart the game from scratch.</li>
<li><strong>The Path</strong> - A map that shows the forks along the road and the challenges you choose to face.</li>
<li><strong>Your Deck</strong> - The deck you draw form that get added to (and removed) throughout the run.  Often added by a random choice of 1 of 3 cards after each challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Your Hand</strong> - The hand you draw during a challenge.  Drawing a new hand of cards each turn until the challenge is won.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking these concepts for the Single Run I see the links as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run + Permadeath</strong> - The single run that we are currently on, and the only one we&rsquo;ll ever have.</li>
<li><strong>The Path</strong> - Represents our life and the choices for how we spend our time throughout the year.</li>
<li><strong>Your Deck</strong> - Represents the life choices we&rsquo;ve made till this point in time, with all the relationships, commitments, habits, trauma and mindsets we bring to the world.</li>
<li><strong>Your Hand</strong> - Each day we get dealt a hand, sometimes they all click and match the challenge exactly, other times it&rsquo;s the complete opposite of what we want.  This is the hand we must play out, we just get to choose how we play it.</li>
</ul>
