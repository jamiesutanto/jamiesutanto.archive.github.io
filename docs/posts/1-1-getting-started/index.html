<p>I consume a diverse set of newsletters / blogs!  From these, I want to lean into posts that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Succinct</li>
<li>Include things I&rsquo;m enjoying (as a callout)</li>
<li>Possibly Handwritten (maybe post-its)</li>
<li>A Question</li>
</ul>
<p>Rogue-like Deckbuilders are fun!  So researching them themselves leads to lots of gaming!  Keen to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the path as a map.  Show the choices I&rsquo;ve taken and left undone untaken.</li>
<li>Use years as the final Boss (maybe Annual Report), with branching paths (tied to goals) and junctures where we decline a boss as well!</li>
<li>Site-map can be based on the path taken!</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-journey">The Journey<a href="#the-journey" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>After passing the Being Hacked tutorial, I felt ready to tackle the world of my first <strong>real</strong> blog post!  The challenge being, I don&rsquo;t yet have a voice&hellip;.</p>
<p>The best approach would be to not worry too much about it and just start writing!  BUT my <em>perfectionist mind</em> thought it&rsquo;d be much better to spend time researching&hellip;..  So today&rsquo;s story is about that journey.</p>
<h3 id="newsletters-i-read">Newsletters I Read<a href="#newsletters-i-read" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>The obvious place to start, is what I actually read and enjoy myself!  Then to think about what I enjoy about each.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seth&rsquo;s Blog - The succint-ness of Seth&rsquo;s Blog is so powerful (even though it seems really hard to do!)  But the ability to distill knowledge into a concise point is worth aspiring to.</li>
<li>Ness Labs - AI Image &gt; What&rsquo;s going on Now &gt; A Concept with Imagery &gt; Post Script (things I&rsquo;m Enjoying).  I always find these newletters insightful, part structure, with the images in particular being a stand-out to make the concept real!</li>
<li>The Imperfectionist - You have to accept that your life is finite!  A title &gt; a concept &gt; bold to emphasise one point &gt; end with a quote / analogy / reference.  This newsletter just speaks to me, which whilst no magic formula can teach me about how to do things.</li>
<li>Zen Habits - Title &gt; Down Arrow &gt; Text.  One bold only!  Start with questions you ask yourself then extrapolate!</li>
<li>The Minimalists - In poetry form.  Short incomplete sentences to represent a whole.</li>
<li>Eric Barker - Very how to.  Picture &gt; Intro &gt; Details &gt; Summary</li>
<li>Shane Parrish - Tiny Thoughts (One liners / three of them seperated by * / ** / *** ) - Insights (Single paragraphs with a lesson) - Repository (link to someone else) - PS (life links / interesting things)</li>
<li>Mathias Jakobsen - The idea of physical pages as newsletters is such a cool one! Challenge being on how to be clear and succinct!  Digital could help!  Ask a question at the end
![[Mathias Jakobsen - Journals as Newsletter.jpg]]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-ill-do-with-it">What I&rsquo;ll do with it<a href="#what-ill-do-with-it" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>With that done &hellip; here&rsquo;s some ideas I like!</p>
<ul>
<li>Succinct</li>
<li>Things I&rsquo;m Enjoying (as a callout)</li>
<li>Possibly Handwritten Page (maybe post-its)</li>
<li>A Question</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="games">Games<a href="#games" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>The Blog is based on the idea of a <strong>rogue-like</strong> so I booted up Slay The Spire and One Step From Eden to see how they record their journey!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slay the Spire</strong> - This actually doesn&rsquo;t show where you are on a Stage, it&rsquo;s just the Path &gt; The Event</li>
<li><strong>One Step From Eden</strong> - This displays your progress on the bottom right corner:
<ul>
<li>1-1 (first choice) 1-2 (second choice) etc until you complete the level.  Then you move on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-ill-do-with-it-1">What I&rsquo;ll do with it<a href="#what-ill-do-with-it-1" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>With the inspiration of games, I can see that it&rsquo;s important to define <strong>what</strong> a level actually is, and what the <strong>end boss</strong> might actually be.  Having a think of the philosophy, time may be the most meaningful juncture with a Quarter or Year being a good milestone to represent the finitude of life.</p>
<p>The choices made (and left behind) could be a great way to link the concepts together, especially for a site-map, so let&rsquo;s see where we go!</p>
