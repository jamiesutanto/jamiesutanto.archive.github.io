## Intro

Hi! My name is Jamie Sutanto and you've stumbled across my site Two Page Journal.  Thanks for being here!

This site is where I post idle  ideas from my life in a two page spread from my Midori A7 Journal.  Here's what I think it brings about!

I hope you enjoy your time here, exploring the idle reflections of my life!

BONUS: Obligatory photo of my two helpers, Lady Gray (tuxedo) + Maitri (white)!
