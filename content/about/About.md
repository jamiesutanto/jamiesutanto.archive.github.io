Hi! My name is Jamie Sutanto and you've stumbled across my site The Single Run.  Thanks for being here!

This site is my personal site where I treat my life with the mindset of a *Single Run*.  

- We all have our own **unique start point** based on our life experience. 
- We have **choices** that we make each and every day. 
- There are **no take backs** and **time always move forwards**.
- And with those in mind, we can now **decide** how we choose to live our lives. 

I hope you enjoy your time here, exploring the random events of my life!
