Blending the concepts of **Mesmer** (from **Guild Wars**) and **Argosi** (from **Sebastian de Castell's** _Greatcoats_ series), we get a combination of **illusion, trickery, manipulation**, and **card games** based on strategy, luck, and social influence. Below are several **concepts** that blend these two fascinating ideas:

### 1. **Illusionary Gambit**

- A game or technique where **Mesmer-like** **illusionary tactics** are used in **trick-taking** games, manipulating the **perception of other players**. Players could use cards, similar to **Argosi**, but also include magical elements that cause opponents to see false hands or play tricks on their minds.
    

### 2. **Trick of the Mind**

- A playstyle where players **read and deceive** their opponents using **psychological tactics**, akin to **Mesmer** illusions and the **Argosi's** art of cards. Players are given the ability to **create false choices**, leading others to misplay or fall for traps while **maintaining an air of diplomacy and poise**.
    

### 3. **Arcane Deception**

- A card game in which **Mesmer-inspired magic** distorts the **reality** of the **cards in play**. Players can use spells to alter what the **opponent sees** or **change outcomes** based on hidden strategies, just like **Argosi cards** manipulating one's future. A player could alter what **cards** their opponents draw or discard.
    

### 4. **The Conductor’s Game**

- A **Mesmeric strategy game** where players control an intricate **web of illusions** that influence the moves of the game. Cards in the game could represent **characters**, **situations**, or **spells**, each one bending the rules of the game in subtle ways. Players could **play both sides** while appearing neutral, weaving intricate deceptions much like an **Argosi** in the **Greatcoats**.
    

### 5. **Ethereal Shuffle**

- A game of chance where **Mesmeric magic** allows players to **switch cards** or **manipulate others' hands**, much like the **Argosi**’s use of card play to affect outcomes. The twist: players may not even know if the magic they cast has altered the results or if they are simply **making decisions** based on trickery.
    

### 6. **Sleight of the Arcana**

- A game or event in which **Mesmer-like illusions** **change the stakes** during the game, shifting the **meaning** of **individual cards**. Like the **Argosi**'s use of cards for communication, players would use illusions to make it unclear whether they are playing truthfully or **influencing others' actions** through **misdirection**.
    

### 7. **The Facade Hand**

- A trick-taking game where players use **Mesmer** techniques to **conceal** or **reveal** cards in their hands. Just like **Argosi**, this would involve **strategic bluffing** and **subtle manipulations** of what’s shown, causing confusion about the state of the game.
    

### 8. **Vesper's Trick**

- A **Mesmer**-infused version of an **Argosi game** where each round features a **bluff** based on **hidden motives** and **emotional manipulation**. Players can **mimic** or **copy** other players' cards, twisting the rules of the game itself, only for the **true result** to be revealed much later, influenced by both **illusion** and **psychological play**.
    

### 9. **Mimicry Pact**

- A **card game** where every **Mesmer** character can **mimic** the **abilities of others**, but at a cost. Players engage in **cooperative deceit**, learning to **read others' intentions** while simultaneously **influencing their own moves** by blending **argosi-inspired card exchanges** with **mind-bending illusions**.
    

### 10. **Illusive Decree**

- A **Mesmer-powered game of social intrigue** combined with **Argosi’s trickery**, where players use **illusionary decrees** that subtly influence others’ decisions. This game would revolve around players casting **spells or challenges** that alter the rules or shape the **cards’ meaning**, creating an atmosphere where no one can be sure if the **outcome is real** or a **deception**.
    

These concepts are designed to blend the **strategic depth** of **trick-taking card games** (like the **Argosi**) with the **illusory, mind-bending powers** of **Mesmers**, offering gameplay that’s about **manipulating perceptions**, **subtle deceptions**, and **mental strategy**. Whether it’s through magical illusions or **bluffing mechanics**, these ideas invite a game experience where every player has to stay one step ahead of their opponents.
