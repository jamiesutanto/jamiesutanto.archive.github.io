# Lesson
- Trust is the foundation and true test of every relationship!
- Make dedicated time for your creative work!  Don't let it consume all your attention.
- Learn and tell each other your needs it makes all the difference.
- Interrogate the 'fixed game' rather than just living in it!
# Hades Town
Today was our second attempt to watch *Hadestown*!  We missed our actual session (the joys of late Calendar reminders....).  So made an extra effort to remember it this time around!  

The only expectation I had was of the game *Hades* so was curious to see how the characters would come to life!  With that one expectation in mind, we walked in and the first thing I saw was the on-stage Jazz Ensemble and knew that it'd be something special!

### My Notes
- A lesson on marriage counselling
- Overworking leading to neglect in the relationship
- Both parties being unaware of each others needs.
- Jazz + Western Styling.
- And the nature of the 'fixed' game they all live in

Really glad I got to see the Australian production and props to all involved, especially the Trombone player (James Greening) who really made the finale something special (even after the cast headed out!)

### Marriage Advice
The premise is the tale of Orpheus + Euridice, and how he'll travel to the depth of Hadestown to bring her back to the land of the living.  As the story unfolds we learn how similar the start of their relationship was to that of Hades + Persephone, and how over the years the drifting values can lead to a strained relationship that was nothing like what it begun.

The spark that Orpheus brings to Hadestown, is the spark that re-connects Hades + Persephone's original love, and as a parting gift Hades instills a trial that he could never complete, the one where he has to have full trust in his partner.  This leads to the un-fulfilled love in the final conclusion that is really the key to a long lasting marriage that both Hades + Orpheus will never see.

### Life is a Stacked Deck
Another parallel is that we all actually live in our own versions of *Hadestown*.  We are on Earth, unsatisfied and yearning for something that we always feel remains un-fulfilled.

We get the offer of a simple life, shopping, TikTok, Social Media, Video Games, Drugs and Alcohol.  Then we sign the dotted line, pick up the new cards in our deck, and work forever until we can eventually get the dream we've always wanted, which actually never comes.

This loop is where we start often in the rigged game of life, where our decisions are dictated by all the things we thought might give us contentment.  And we need some spark to give us a chance at escaping, and then we are given the chance to try.  To try to move beyond, but we often look back and get trapped again in the same cycle.  Possibly a little different, but often with enough try's we get weary and forget our names and the dreams we even started with...

The hope being that the musical itself can be the spark that will be a mirror to your own 'rigged' situation and give you the chance to come back!
