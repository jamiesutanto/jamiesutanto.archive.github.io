## Lesson
Trust is the foundation and true test of every relationship!
Make dedicated time for your creative work!  Don't let it consume all your attention.
Learn and tell each other your needs it makes all the difference.
Interrogate the 'fixed game' rather than just living in it!
Jazz + Western Styling is alive in Sydney!

# Hades Town
Today was our second attempt to watch *Hadestown*!  We missed our actual session (the joys of late Calendar reminders....).  So made an extra effort to remember it this time around!  

The only expectation I had was of the game *Hades* so was curious to see how the characters would come to life!  With that one expectation in mind, we walked in and the first thing I saw was the on-stage Jazz Ensemble and knew that it'd be something special!

### Spoilers Ahead!
The premise is the tale of Orpheus + Euridice, and how he'll travel to the depth of Hadestown to bring her back to the land of the living.  As the story unfolds we learn how similar the start of their relationship was to that of Hades + Persephone, and how over the years the drifting values can lead to a strained relationship that was nothing like what it begun.

The spark that Orpheus brings to Hadestown, is the spark that re-connects Hades + Persephone's original love, and as a parting gift Hades instills a trial that he could never complete, the one where he has to have full trust in his partner.  This leads to the un-fulfilled love in the final conclusion that is really the key to a long lasting marriage that both Hades + Orpheus will never see.

All up I wrote:
- A lesson on marriage counselling
- Overworking leading to neglect in the relationship
- Both parties being unaware of each others needs.
- Jazz + Western Styling.
- And the nature of the 'fixed' game they all live in

This was just on the surface of it all, without even covering the elements of capitalism, the need for control and the connotations of walls + shackles that Hades builds.  But for me the core reminder of what it takes to have a great relationship thrown through (oh and the jazz of course too!)

Really glad I got to see the Australian production and props to all involved, especially the Trombone player (James Greening) who really made the finale something special (even after the cast headed out!)

## Next
Now inspired to play *Hades* all over again or better yet *Hades II*!
