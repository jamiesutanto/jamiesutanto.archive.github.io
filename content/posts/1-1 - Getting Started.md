# Lesson

Still too perfectionist to not just **do**, but **research first**! 

The newsletters / blogs I consume are quite diverse!  I want to lean into posts that are:
- Succinct 
- Include things I'm enjoying (as a callout)
- Possibly Handwritten (maybe post-its)
- A Question

Rogue-like Deckbuilders are fun!  So researching them themselves leads to lots of gaming!  Keen to:
- Use the path as a map.  With choices both taken and untaken.
- Use years as the final Boss (maybe Annual Report).  Since MTO Goals may not actually be met!
	- Could have branching paths, for junctures where we decline a boss too!
- Site-map can be based on the path taken!



# Story

### Intro
After passing the Being Hacked tutorial, I felt ready to tackle the world of my first **real** blog post!  The challenge being, I don't yet have a voice....

The best approach would be to not worry too much about it and just start writing!  BUT my *perfectionist mind* thought it'd be much better to spend time researching.....  So today's story is about that journey.

### Newsletters I Read
The obvious place to start, is what I actually read and enjoy myself!  Then to think about what I enjoy about each.

Seth's Blog - The succint-ness of Seth's Blog is so powerful (even though it seems really hard to do!)  But the ability to distill knowledge into a concise point is worth aspiring to.
Ness Labs - AI Image > What's going on Now > A Concept with Imagery > Post Script (things I'm Enjoying).  I always find these newletters insightful, part structure, with the images in particular being a stand-out to make the concept real!
The Imperfectionist - You have to accept that your life is finite!  A title > a concept > bold to emphasise one point > end with a quote / analogy / reference.  This newsletter just speaks to me, which whilst no magic formula can teach me about how to do things. 
Zen Habits - Title > Down Arrow > Text.  One bold only!  Start with questions you ask yourself then extrapolate!
The Minimalists - In poetry form.  Short incomplete sentences to represent a whole.
Eric Barker - Very how to.  Picture > Intro > Details > Summary
Shane Parrish - Tiny Thoughts (One liners / three of them seperated by * / ** / *** ) - Insights (Single paragraphs with a lesson) - Repository (link to someone else) - PS (life links / interesting things)
Mathias Jakobsen - The idea of physical pages as newsletters is such a cool one! Challenge being on how to be clear and succinct!  Digital could help!  Ask a question at the end

### What I'll do with it

With that done ... here's some ideas I like!
- Succinct 
- Things I'm Enjoying (as a callout)
- Possibly Handwritten Page (maybe post-its)
- A Question

# Games
The Blog is based on the idea of a **rogue-like** so I booted up Slay The Spire and One Step From Eden to see how they record their journey!

### Slay the Spire
This actually doesn't show where you are on a Stage, it's just the Path > The Event

### One Step From Eden
This displays your progress on the bottom right corner:
1-1 (first choice) 1-2 (second choice) etc until you complete the level.  Then you move on.

### Ideas
The structure of having some [MTO Goal](https://aaron.com/2013/08/13/the-best-goal-achievement-strategy/) may be a good way to define these *Levels* BUT what if we change the goal posts or never get there entirely?  How does that work in the system?  Or is it just time itself - A year or some meaningful juncture between Annual Reports? 

If we could have an image of the path (and the one not taken that would be quite cool too!)  It shows intentionality on where you are going!

This can be a site-map as well let's see!
